1. LeNet-5 Architecture: LeNet-5 consists of seven layers, including two convolutional layers followed by average pooling layers, and then fully connected layers at the end.
Sigmoid activation functions were used in the earlier layers, and the final layer employed a softmax activation function for classification. It was specifically designed for 
recognizing handwritten digits in images.
